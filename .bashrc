# This file is unused at the moment. My hosts symlink from the home directory
# to the corresponding file in this git project. So for example, MacOS is
# symlinking as such:
#
#   .bashrc -> .bash_profile
#
# This is due to the different between how MacOS and Linux use the `*rc`,
# `*login`, and `*profile` variants of the files.
